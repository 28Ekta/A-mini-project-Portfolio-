A personal portfolio website built with HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript. This project highlights my skills, projects, and contact details in a clean and responsive layout. It serves as an introduction to me as a web developer, designer, and lifelong learner, showcasing my work and providing an easy way to connect.
